Once Monk was watching a fight between an array and a tree, of being better. Tree
got frustrated and converted that array into a Binary Search Tree by inserting the
elements as nodes in BST, processing elements in the given order in the array. Now
Monk wants to know the height of the created Binary Search Tree.
Help Monk for the same.
